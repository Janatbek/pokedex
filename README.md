# pokedex
1. jQuery function to show all pokemons from src='http://pokeapi.co/media/img/ API
2. jQuery function to show all description about pokemons in other div. used .on build in function, because i am clicking on dinamically rendered html.
3.has API call, and it's very slow. if you are cliking and you don't see the result it means page is loading, wait little bit.
